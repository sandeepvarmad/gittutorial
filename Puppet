Why we need Configuration Management?
-Configuring large infrastructure was a very hectic job.
-Rollback to previous stable version of the software was very difficult it takes lot of time.
-An application works in devloper's machine but not in testing or production.In Dev there can be a software that is updated but in Prod the old version might be present.
-There can be inconsistency in the computing env due the application might work in Dev but may not work in Prod.

Configuration Management - It is the practise of handling changes systematically so that a system maintains its integrity over time.It allows access to an accurate historical record of system stale.
is basically a process that helps you to manage chages in your infrastructure in most systematic and structured way.
-If you are updating a software you keep a record of changes or updates you make to the infrastructure.
-You achieve configuration management by using Infrastructure as code (IAC)
-IAC - the code you write for the infrastructure in one central location You can name a master or server etc. 
 That code is deployed into Dev,Prod & QA env.You can push the code whichever node or env you want.

Solution for Configuring large infrastructure was a very hectic job
-Write code in one central location and replicate that in n number of nodes advantage of Configuration Management.

Solution for Rollback to previous stable version of the software was very difficult it takes lot of time.
-As everything is well documented at one location rollbacking is not a time consuming process.

Solution for There can be inconsistency in the computing env
-Becasue of IAC all the three enviroments will have the same computing env.
