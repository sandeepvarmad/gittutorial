	SSH:Secure Shell Hosting

Secure Shell is a program to log into another computer over a network, to execute commands in a remote machine, and to move files from one machine to another. It provides strong authentication and secure communications over insecure channels. It is a replacement for rlogin, rsh, rcp, and rdist. 

When using ssh's slogin (instead of rlogin) the entire login session, including transmission of password, is encrypted; therefore it is almost impossible for an outsider to collect passwords. 

SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow the remote computer to authenticate the user, if necessary. 

File transfer can be accomplished using the associated SFTP or SCP protocols. 

By defalut, listens on the standard TCP port 22.

	SCP: Secure Copying

Copies files over the network securely; uses ssh for data transfer, using the same authentication and providing the same security as ssh.

#scp source destination 

ex: - #scp dump.sql 192.168.0.101:/opt

	Key genartion:

#ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 1024

Copy public key to remote location

#scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub 192.168.0.101:.ssh

#ssh 192.168.0.101
#cp id_rsa.pub autorized_keys2 # if the file does not exist
#cat id_rsa.pub >>authorized_keys2 # if the file exists
#exit
#ssh 192.168.0.101

	WinSCP

WinSCP is a small, free, open-source file transfer client for Windows that uses Secure Shell (SSH) technology to enable the safe copying of files between a local and a remote PC using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), SSH FTP, or SCP (Secure Copy) protocols, as well as offering some basic file management features.
